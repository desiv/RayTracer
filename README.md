Simple raytracing


C++ Ray tracer implementation on windows by Marius Savickas

NOTE: I did not intend to do it cross-platform, bet I believe it shouldn't be hard to port it.

There are still lots of things to do, but I have implemented the basic functionality of a ray tracer: rendering spheres, ellipsoids, triangles(meshes), colors, lights, anti-aliasing.

Pointing out problems with the code: main problem is with the camera. With a little bit more tweaking with fovy, it should be working correctly. Furthermore, the code should be optimized, especially working with larger meshes

Also I have not debugged it to the fullest, so there might still be some bugs, but the scenes included in the bin folder should be working.

You are free to do anything with this code.

Cheers.
